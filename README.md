# Assignment 1 – Object-Oriented Student Management System

## Project Overview
This project implements a simple Student Management System using Java.
It demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming principles such as
encapsulation, abstraction, constructors, getters/setters, arrays of objects,
and composition between classes.

## Classes Description

### Student Class
The `Student` class represents a student with the following fields:
- name
- id
- major
- gpa
- credits

It includes getters and setters, GPA validation, credit accumulation,
honors status checking, and a clear `toString()` representation.

### Course Class
The `Course` class represents a cour      se and demonstrates composition
by storing an array of `Student` objects.
It can add students, calculate average GPA, and find the student
with the highest credits.

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
